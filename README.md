I created the 3 pages as requested
All pages have nav bar
All pages have navbar with drop down
All pages have Responsive inages, nav bar and dropdown
Created the objects, class's,
linked in the css page
modified margin, padding and display px
added bootstrap scripts
created the CSS page 
Had it all working and then it went haywire as Dustin can attest to. 
Have a good day
